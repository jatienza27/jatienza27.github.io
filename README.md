Jasmine Atienza

I am taking Web200 as the next step in getting my associate's degree in web design and development. I do not have much experience in coding and so I only know a little about Javascript. But I hope this course will give me a better understanding of it and help me to gain experience using it. I hope to use what I learn from this course to help further my education and help achieve my degree. Afterwards, I hope to use everything I learn to pursue a career as a web developer or in UX/UI design.
